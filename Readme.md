<h1>About the App:</h1>
The app I have created is a native Android application designed for managing purchases.
It provides users with a convenient way to track their purchases,
<h1>Technologies:</h1>
The app utilizes the Room library, which is an Android architecture component,
for storing and managing data. Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite,
allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval. With Room, the app can store purchase information,
such as product details and prices, in a structured manner and perform database operations smoothly.

In addition to Room, the app integrates barcode and QR code scanning functionality.
This feature enables users to scan product barcodes or QR codes using their device's camera.
The app utilizes barcode and QR code scanning libraries to process the scanned codes and retrieve product information.
This technology simplifies the process of adding purchases to the app by automatically fetching product details,
such as name, price, and description, based on the scanned code.
